# ReAct Agent

This implementation of the ReAct pattern for LLMs by Simon Willison extends the capabilities of a language model by allowing it to access external tools like Wikipedia, blog search, and calculations. The process follows a loop of Thought → Action → Observation, where the LLM considers a question, calls an external action, and then processes the results before providing an answer.

Breakdown of Key Points:
ReAct Pattern:

Reason + Act (ReAct): This pattern allows LLMs to perform actions (like making API calls or running calculations) and integrate the results back into its reasoning loop.
The LLM is taught to use tools like Wikipedia, blog searches, and Python’s eval() for calculations to assist in reasoning.
Example Actions:

Wikipedia search: The LLM can look up information on Wikipedia for any query.
Blog search: It can search Simon Willison's blog for relevant entries.
Calculation: Python's eval() is used for simple calculations (though it mentions this should be sandboxed for safety).
Code Explanation:

ChatBot Class: The chatbot operates by keeping track of the conversation and executing actions when necessary. It interacts with OpenAI’s API and calls different functions (like Wikipedia or blog search).
Action Handlers: Functions like wikipedia(), simon_blog_search(), and calculate() define how external actions are performed and return the results.
Prompt Design: The chatbot is guided by a prompt structure that encourages it to think about actions it needs to take and how to process observations.
How It Works:

The chatbot considers a question, determines the necessary action (e.g., a Wikipedia search), executes the action, and then processes the result to return an answer.
For example, if asked about England’s borders, it would search Wikipedia, observe the result, and then answer based on the observation.
Potential Improvements:

The use of eval() for calculations is unsafe and should be sandboxed (e.g., using WebAssembly).
The implementation can be further expanded with more tools and safety mechanisms.
Key Observations:
This implementation is very concise, showing how relatively few lines of code can add useful capabilities to an LLM.
The ReAct pattern opens up the possibility for LLMs to interact with dynamic sources of information, improving the quality and accuracy of their responses.
The ReAct pattern is a powerful concept for expanding the utility of language models, allowing them to take actions and reason based on real-time data.
